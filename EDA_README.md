# Data Science EDA Milestone
## Choosing a dataset
Before you start your milestone/project, the first thing that you need to do is choose a dataset that has been approved by your instructor or your TA. To give you an idea of what has been used in the past, here's a list of potential ideas:
1. Air BnB data from either NYC or one from a city of your choice, which can be found here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/
  - If you choose the NYC dataset, feel free to use the one from the activities
  - If you choose another city (or want a more updated NYC dataset), please use the file that corresponds to the "Detailed listings data" 
2. One (or more) of the sales, stores and/or counties tables from the Big Data Management milestone
  - As an idea, some have even retrieved their data by joining tables using PostgreSQL, pgAdmin4 or Psycopg2 (Python)
3. Wine Reviews: 130k wine reviews with variety, location, winery, price, and description

4. Customer Churn:

5. Spotify:

## When doing your exploratory analysis, here are some questions that might help guide you:
- What story are you trying to tell? [most important!]
  - For example, if you're analyzing price, _why_ are you analyzing price? What can this effect?
  - What do you expect to happen? What actually happened?
- Could the reader easily follow what you're doing?
  - Note: It's recommended that you supplement your analysis with text!!
- Is your analysis split into logical sections?
- Who are you presenting this EDA to? Always consider your audience!

## When we go over your project, here are some of the things that you might want to consider:
- Dealing with missing values, duplicates and outliers
- Data cleaning (i.e. removing $'s)
- Readability of graphs and analyses
- Proper handling of variables depending on data type
- Interpretability of statistics
- Choosing the "proper" graphs 
- Organization (i.e. titles, subtitles, additional text)
- Easiness to understand and follow
  - Hint: Think about who you're presenting to!
- As always, additional effort!

## If you'd like to generate some ideas as to what a good EDA looks like, take a look at the following Kaggle repositories:

## What to do after completing your EDA
After you've completed your EDA, please do the following:
1. Create your <b>OWN</b> Github repository: https://github.com/new 
2. If not included already in your notebook, provide a link of where I can download the data, what SQL commands you used to generate the data, etc.. <b><u>IMPORTANT: I cannot reproduce your EDA without the data so if you do not include this, I will not read or grade your EDA at all.</b></u>
2. Upload your `.ipynb` notebook into your repository.
3. Send me a link to your own Github repository on Slack. If your repository is public, sending the Github link is fine. If your repostiory is private, add me as a collaborator (Settings > Collaborators > Add People > nicholas-abad)
